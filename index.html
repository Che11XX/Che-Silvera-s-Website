            <h2>The History of the Steel Drum</h2>
          <br> 
          
            <p> The first instrument to arise in ther devlopment of the steel drum was an instrument called the "Tamboo Bamboo".
               This version of the instrument was played using tunable sticks mqde of Bamboo, which were hit on the ground along with other sticks to produce a very clean "tack" sound.
              These Tamboo Bamboo bands also used different materials to produce differnt notes such as biscuit tins and oil drums. 
             </p>

             <h2> 1930's </h2>
             <div><p> In the ealry 1930's metal percussion were starting to become more common amongst the "Tamboo Bamboo" bands.
                The metals used were also changes , bands starting using car brake hub or the biscut drum. This led to even more variattions to how the instrument was played like the use of creating heavier bamboo stick that woulld be use as the "bass" for the band</p></div>

                   <hr>
                   <h2> 1940's </h2>
                <p>By the late 1930s  all-steel bands were seen at Carnival and by 1940 it had become the preferred Carnival instrument for young underprivileged men. 
                  The 55-gallon oil drum was incorporated into the instrument used to make lead steel pans from around 1947.Which led to ther next evolution of the instrument </p>

                  <hr>

                  <h2> 1950's </h2>
                  <p>The Steel Pan instrument first appeared on British TV in 1950, when Trinidadian Boscoe Holder and his Caribbean Dancers performed with a steel band on his own television show, Bal Creole, broadcast in June 1950 on BBC Television.
                     With the exposure of the instrument so widely broadcast the previous year, The Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra (TASPO) were invited to play in the summer of 1951 on the Southbank in London as part of the ‘Festival of Britain’.</p>

                    <h2> 1990's</h2>
                    <p>in 1992 the steel pan became the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago acknowledging the progress made at home and abroad. The steel band is now much more than just entertainment for a Caribbean themed party. It is an orchestra of hundreds playing any style of music from traditional classical to dynamic and original compositions, it is also an experimental ensemble working with other instruments to create new work. </p>

                     <h2> 2010 </h2>
                     <p>The steel pan evolved over time with the invention of the Electronic Pan (E-Pan). It's creator, Salmon Cupid, created a stand alone pan which incorporates built in tones from various instruments and built in speakers. Its unique sounds has made it a well sought after instrument in steel orchestras. </p>

            <h1>About me and my experience with Pan</h1>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <br> 
          
            <p> My name is Che Silvera and from a very young age I started learning how to play the Steel Drum. Coming from a Carribean background, Jamaica on my dad's side and Trinidad on my mom's side, learning about cultures has always been a big part of my life. Along with that, came learning about The steel Drum which quickly became a passion of mine.
              In 2019, I had the opportunity to learn with and play  in Toronto's most popular steel orchestra, Toronto All Star Steel Pan Orchestra(TASSO) and have had the privelege to play in a few popular events, such as the Toronto Raptors' Championship Parade. The band is also apart of many International Competetions and have won many of them. I created this website to inform people of this hidden gem, The Steel Drum. The instrument doesn't get as much attention as it deserves and I want to teach people why they should learn, through the discorvery of the history, performances and more! I hope that you will learn to appreciate the craftsmanship of the pan but most importantly, that you will find a connections to the beautiful melodies that the steel pan echos. The sounds of the steel pan bring people together and it has the ability to lighten moods and have people dancing. It reaches audiences globally and draws a diverse community of players together.
